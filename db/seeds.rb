# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# User.create([
#     {username: "h_annah", name: "hannah", password: "test",email: "h_annah@123.com"  },
#     {username: "A_manda", name: "Amanda", password: "test", email: "A_manda@123.com" },
#     {username: "e_lombardo", name: "eric", password: "test", email: "e_lombardo@123.com", }
#     ])
